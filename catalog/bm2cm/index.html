			<h2>Description</h2>
			<p>
			"the point of happy land is not to make something pretty or even something that strikes emotion in people, the only goal of happy land is to be something unique"
			<br><br>
			New experimental electroacoustic / musique concréte album from electronic producer unsent! Even though happy land is wildly different from unsent's usual electronic / chiptune style, the album is still a very worthy release, with some amazing textures and sounds throughout the album's 28 tracks, made even more impressive by the fact that the album was largely improvised! Definitely worth a listen if you are into any sort of experimental electronic...
			<br><br>
			If you enjoyed this album, would like to support the artist more directly or are just curious, you can find more of unsent's work over at unsent.bandcamp.com/music ! Many thanks to her for allowing BMCM to release this!
